# MATH QUIZ
Math Game in assembly is an interactive math quiz program. It will generate problems in console and user will have to input the answers. Starting point of the program is menu, where user selects to start the game, see the score or exit the quiz. 
By choosing “1” to start, the user goes to the first question. Each round consist of four math equations and the user should correctly answer each of them. If the question is answered correctly, one point will be given to the user. Otherwise, user losses one point for every incorrect answer. Scores are accumulative and overall score can be viewed from menu by entering “2”. The user will exit the program by inputting “3”.
The variables of the equations will be generated by pseudorandom number algorithm. There will be four type of equations and as user plays new round he/she have to solve the equation with different numbers. The program will compute answers of these equations using arithmetic operations and will compare to user input.

For demonstration, Project uses Windows system PC with Code::Blocks. The project uses x86 32-bit assembly functions written in AT&T syntax.
